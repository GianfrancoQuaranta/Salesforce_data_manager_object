# Project Overview

## Summary  
This project is the result of a part of my professional experience. It has been anonymized to be presented for academic purposes.  

## Problem  
- The client received a new CRM with data migrated from another system, a process carried out by a third party.  
- The client detected inconsistencies in their reports, which were generated within the CRM. This was causing performance issues in the company.  
- Until that moment, the client was unaware of their system’s data structure.  
- The client had no access to the data outside the system.  
- More than 500 people used the CRM daily.  
- Thousands of new records were generated every day.  

## Procedure  
- Meetings were held with the stakeholders affected by this situation.  
- An investigation into the development and data migration was conducted, but the available information was scarce, and the third party responsible did not provide any solutions.  
- Research was conducted on the CRM’s connection and data structure. Despite being a well-known CRM, there was not enough available information.  
- A Python-based connection method was developed, configuring remote access from the system.  
- A discovery process was initiated to analyze the data structure, as well as the database’s functionality and characteristics.  
- It was confirmed that the database was a customized, object-oriented relational database, just like the system itself.  
- The discovery process focused on identifying the parent object and understanding how all objects were related. There was no existing ERD, but a tool, Salesforce Schema, occasionally helped.  
- The process was documented periodically.  
- A business analysis was conducted to define the main entities used daily, their relationships, cardinality, and how information flowed between them.  
- This step guided the definition and discovery of the primary objects composing each entity’s records.  
- It was discovered that the database contained 1,100 objects, a large percentage of which were unused.  
- Query rules existed based on each object's characteristics, along with multiple query restrictions. SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language) was used. Modules were created with rules tailored to different scenarios.  
- All methods handled exceptions, measured execution time, and included a debugging system.  
- After establishing the connection and performing the first data extractions, the goal was to retrieve all information from each object, starting with the general metadata object and each entity’s metadata.  
- A test query was run on every field of each entity, as the system did not allow extracting all data at once.  
- Data was extracted from each main entity using the functional columns.  
- Data was prepared for graphical analysis.  
- A visualization module was developed to represent the completeness status of each entity.  

## Notes  
- The project’s initial draft was developed in Jupyter Notebook, structured as a class with numerous methods, private variables, and public variables.  
- In later versions, responsibilities were modularized to improve maintainability and adhere to best practices.  
- The project was deployed on Azure.  
- The entire process was documented.  

## Outcomes  
- The company gained knowledge and control over its data.  
- Data-driven decision-making was facilitated and enhanced.  
- Large-scale data cleaning and normalization projects emerged, involving numerous multidisciplinary teams.  
- Multiple teams, including Finance, Marketing, Automation, and DevOps, gained access to the data for their operations.  
- Several data migration projects were initiated for other sources within the company.  
- New integrations were established with large-scale communication systems, as well as Jira for company-wide project supervision by the PM team.  
- New online and offline mass marketing initiatives emerged.  
- Thousands of dollars were saved through process optimization.  
- Thousands of dollars were generated by discovering new potential clients.  
- A new Data Engineering team was created.  
- A data warehouse was built, taking the company’s data capabilities to the next level.  
- The product team expanded from around 10 projects to over 80, becoming the most relevant team within the company in less than six months.
